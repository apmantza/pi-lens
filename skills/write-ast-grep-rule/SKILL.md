# Writing a pi-lens ast-grep Rule

Drop path: `rules/ast-grep-rules/rules/<id>.yml`  
Same `id` as a built-in overrides it. Multiple rules per file: separate with `---`.

## Minimal template

```yaml
id: no-foo-bar
language: TypeScript        # PascalCase — see languages below
severity: warning           # error | warning | info
message: "Avoid foo.bar() — use baz() instead"
note: |
  Longer explanation / fix guidance here.
rule:
  pattern: foo.bar($ARG)
```

## Language values

`TypeScript` `JavaScript` `Python` `Go` `Rust` `Java` `C` `Cpp` `CSharp` `Kotlin` `Ruby` `Php`

## Rule conditions

```yaml
rule:
  pattern: foo($X)          # ast-grep pattern — $X single, $$$ARGS multi
  kind: call_expression     # AST node kind (alternative to pattern)
  regex: "secret|token"     # regex on node text
  has:                      # descendant must match
    pattern: await $$$
  not:
    kind: comment
  any:
    - pattern: foo($X)
    - pattern: bar($X)
  all:
    - pattern: $OBJ.send($$$)
    - not: { kind: await_expression }
```

## Relational & constraint conditions — all supported (native napi, #206)

The runner matches every rule through napi's native engine (`root.findAll({rule,
constraints})`), fed by a faithful `js-yaml` parse. The **full ast-grep grammar works** —
nest freely; nothing is silently skipped:

```yaml
rule:
  kind: call_expression
  inside:                     # ancestor must match
    kind: function_declaration
    stopBy: end               # ↑ search ALL ancestors (default is direct parent)
  has:                        # descendant must match (default: DIRECT child)
    field: arguments          # field constraints work
  follows:                    # immediately-preceding sibling
    pattern: const $X = $V
constraints:                  # metavariable regex constraints work
  X:
    regex: "Error$"
```

⚠ **`has`/`inside` default to the immediate child/parent (`stopBy: neighbor`).** For a
recursive descendant/ancestor search add `stopBy: end`. This is the #1 migration
gotcha — see the `has` note below.

## YAML quoting — REQUIRED (js-yaml will reject the rule otherwise)

The parser is a real YAML parser, so unquoted special chars throw and the rule is
**silently dropped**:

```
❌ message: !!value to coerce boolean    # `!!` is a YAML tag → js-yaml THROWS, rule dropped
✅ message: "!!value to coerce boolean"
❌ message: foo: bar baz                  # bare `:` → parsed as a nested mapping
✅ message: "foo: bar baz"
   Quote any scalar starting with  ! & * ? | > % @ `  or containing  : #
   Quote keyword-like kinds:  kind: "true"   (bare `true` becomes a boolean → invalid kind)
```

## Gotchas

```
❌ Overly broad patterns — filtered out automatically
   $VAR  $NAME  $_  $X  $EXPR  (single bare metavar)

❌ PascalCase language is required
   language: typescript  →  language: TypeScript

❌ $VAR inside strings — matches literal "$VAR", not a metavar
   "from $PATH"  →  use tree-sitter or grep instead

✅ Test in playground: https://ast-grep.github.io/playground.html
✅ Schema + autocomplete: rules/ast-grep-rules/rule-schema.json
✅ Docs: docs/custom-rules.md
```

## Hard-won gotchas (NAPI runner specifics — verified)

```
⚠ `has`/`inside` default to DIRECT child/parent — add `stopBy: end` for a recursive search.
   This cuts BOTH ways, so think about where the target node actually lives:
   - Target is a grandchild+ → you MUST add `stopBy: end` or the `has` never matches.
     `switch-without-default` = `switch_statement` not has `switch_default`: the default
     lives under `switch_body`, so without `stopBy: end` it matches nothing and every
     switch (even ones WITH a default) is flagged. Same for `nested-ternary` catching a
     parenthesized `a ? (b ? c : d) : e`.
   - Target is the direct child → leave it at `neighbor` (default). Adding `stopBy: end`
     OVER-reports: `throw_statement` has `string` + `stopBy: end` flags `throw new
     Error("x")` (the string is nested), and `expression_statement` has `new_expression`
     + `stopBy: end` flags `fn(new Error())` as a discarded error. Keep these direct.
   napi's `has` never matches the node itself, so a self-referential `kind: X` has
   `kind: X` (with `stopBy: end`) correctly flags only genuinely-nested X.

✅ Prefer `regex` on the matched node's OWN text over `has` when you only need to
   inspect the node — avoids recursive-descendant false positives:
     kind: export_statement
     regex: '^export\s+(let|var)\b'      # precise; no has-recursion FP
   (NAPI evaluates `regex` with JS RegExp on node.text() — keep it LINEAR so the
   detector can't itself ReDoS.)

⚠ String-literal regexes match SOURCE text, not the runtime string value.
   Inspect the exact node text before writing constraints:
     ast-grep run --kind string --lang ts sample.ts --json=compact
   Example: source `"\\|"` is node text `"\\\\|"` in JSON; to match a
   source-level escaped backslash (`\\`) followed by a non-backslash, the rule
   regex needs FOUR regex backslashes, preferably in a YAML block scalar:
     regex: >-
       ^["'`]\\\\[^\\A-Za-z0-9$]
   This is how `incomplete-string-escaping` catches both `"\\|"` and
   `'\\"'`. Avoid shell here-doc probes for this class — shell/JSON escaping
   can silently eat a backslash and make the rule look broken.

⚠ `-js` twins: remember there are TWO execution surfaces.
   - ast-grep CLI/LSP language-gates by `language:`. A `language: TypeScript`
     rule is not enough for standalone `.js` coverage, so shipped user-facing
     TS/JS rules that should fire under the ast-grep LSP usually need a `-js`
     twin with `language: JavaScript` plus its own fixture.
   - the in-process NAPI fallback (`ast-grep-napi.ts`) parses the target file's
     own grammar and currently runs both TS and JS rules on every jsts file. A
     grammar-agnostic twin can therefore duplicate in fallback mode.
   - **Decide explicitly:** if the rule must cover `.js` through the ast-grep
     CLI/LSP baseline, ship the twin and test both. If a rule is NAPI-only or
     fallback duplication is unacceptable, fix runner dedup/normalization before
     relying on a single TypeScript rule for JS coverage.
   - **Grammar-divergent bodies** still need separate variants regardless:
     e.g. `no-flag-argument` uses `required_parameter` in TS and
     `assignment_pattern` in JS.

✅ Node-kind facts (tree-sitter-typescript grammar — NOT the TS compiler / Roslyn):
   - let / const  → `lexical_declaration`     (var is NOT here)
   - var          → `variable_declaration`
   - a regex literal's pattern text  → `regex_pattern`
   - x[i] index access  → `subscript_expression`   (NOT element_access_expression)
   - obj.prop access    → `member_expression`      (NOT property_access_expression)
   - !x / -x / typeof x → `unary_expression`
   - a ? b : c          → `ternary_expression`

❌ Wrong-grammar kind names = silent dead rule. `element_access_expression`,
   `property_access_expression`, `binary_operator`, etc. are TS-compiler/Roslyn names, not
   tree-sitter's. napi REJECTS the whole rule ("invalid kind matcher") so it never runs.
   Verify a kind exists before shipping:
     node -e 'import("@ast-grep/napi").then(s=>{const r=s.ts.parse("x[i]").root();
       const f=(n,k)=>{let c=n.kind()===k?1:0;for(const x of n.children())c+=f(x,k);return c};
       console.log(f(r,"subscript_expression"))})'   # >0 means the kind is real

✅ Test through the REAL runner from the repo root — it loads the actual shipped
   rules from rules/ast-grep-rules/rules. Assert on diagnostic `rule` ids:
     const res = await runner.run(ctx);  // ctx.filePath = temp .ts, cwd = repo
   For pattern/kind/regex-only rules (CLI-identical semantics) `ast-grep scan` is fine.

✅ Before shipping any text/regex detector, FP-scan the codebase:
     ast-grep scan -r <rule>.yml clients tools
   Real safe variants bite (e.g. ReDoS: (ba+)+ is safe — a mandatory prefix makes
   the partition unique; flag only a single quantified atom inside the group).
```

## Matching things a pattern can't express (#305)

```
❌ A parameter default is NOT a `$X = false` pattern. `pattern: $FLAG = false` parses as
   an `assignment_expression` (statement context) and never matches a function parameter.
   Match the PARAM NODE + its child literal instead, capturing the name for reuse:
     # TS grammar
     - kind: required_parameter
       all:
         - has: { field: pattern, pattern: $FLAG }
         - has: { any: [ { kind: "true" }, { kind: "false" } ] }
     # JS grammar (assignment_pattern, with fields left/right)
     - kind: assignment_pattern
       all:
         - has: { field: left, pattern: $FLAG }
         - has: { field: right, any: [ { kind: "true" }, { kind: "false" } ] }

✅ Metavar consistency works ACROSS sibling clauses of an `all` — a metavar bound in one
   `has` must match the SAME text everywhere it reappears. Use it to CORRELATE nodes, which
   is what makes a structural rule precise:
     all:
       - has: { stopBy: end, kind: required_parameter, has: { field: pattern, pattern: $FLAG } }
       - has: { stopBy: end, any: [ { pattern: "if ($FLAG) $$$" }, { pattern: "if (!$FLAG) $$$" } ] }
   This fires ONLY when the function branches on the SAME param it declared boolean — a
   boolean default that's never branched on, or a branch on a different var, won't match.

❌ Two `has:` keys in one mapping silently OVERWRITE (YAML: last key wins). For multiple
   descendant constraints use `all:` with a LIST of `has` entries, never repeated `has:`.

✅ Prefer a high-precision structural guard over an unbounded denylist. Message-chain
   (Demeter) floods on fluent/promise/builder chains; rather than denylist every fluent
   method name, REQUIRE the chain's first calls to be accessors (`get*`/`is*`/`has*`) via
   `constraints` regex — promise/fluent/builder methods aren't accessor-named, so they're
   excluded by construction. Precision over recall.

## Validating a candidate rule against the REAL engine (not the warm MCP cache)

```

# inspect how a PATTERN parses → find the node kind you actually need

ast-grep run -p 'x = false' --lang ts --debug-query=cst file.ts

# match by kind (──kind and ──pattern are mutually exclusive in `run`)

ast-grep run --kind required_parameter --lang ts file.ts

# run ONE rule from an sgconfig against a sample

ast-grep scan -c <sgconfig.yml> --filter '^<id>$' sample.ts

# run the fixture harness for one rule

ast-grep test -c rules/ast-grep-rules/.sgconfig.yml --skip-snapshot-tests --filter '<id>'

```
