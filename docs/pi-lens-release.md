## Build, packaging, and release

`main` and `pi.extensions` point to `dist/index.js`; `dist/` is generated and
not committed. `prepare` builds it for git and package installs. `build:dist`
bundles pure-JS dependencies while keeping host-provided and lazy native
packages external. Package-root resource resolution is depth-robust; pi
resolves `pi.skills` entries relative to the package root, so manifests use
`"./skills"` and never an escaping path.

Runtime imports must be production dependencies. The pi SDK is an optional
peer/dev dependency and must be imported type-only. Lockfiles use the pinned
npm version. Release notes use one `.changelog/<slug>.md` fragment per PR
(`audience: user` or `internal`; the release body lists only `user`); never
edit `CHANGELOG.md` for ordinary PR notes.
A `user` fragment carries an `area` and the one shape
`- **Headline sentence.** Body. (refs #N)`; `.changelog/README.md` lists the
rules, and internal fragments are exempt.
